# CSSC-Class-Generator

Currently hard coded to get the list of Fall classes for COMPSCI

Comment out `options.headless();` on line 13 in `selenium.ts` to watch the actions take place in browser

I'm bad at ts so you'll have to figure out how to get it to run

### TODO:
* swap to headless browser
